# VerySimpleFileSystem

## Description
  This is a simplified version of a filesystem that merely mimics the performance of a filesystem
## The Task
  You are being tasked with building the ‘vsfs’ that is described in Chapter 40 of the online textbook Three Easy Pieces. 
  The idea is to mimic the description as accurately as possible, in Python. This should only live in the command-line (CLI), 
  or not graphically. To receive full credit, you need to implement at least 70% of the elements listed in the 
  chapter.
## List of things implemented
    ###block
    ###inode
    ###	Acess methods:
    ###	    open()
    ###	    read()
    ###	    write()
    ###superblock
    ###data region: 56/64 is data region
    ###metadata: data about data
    ###allocation structures.
